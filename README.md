# Final Project - A glossary of Louisiana French figures of speech

Project consists of a glossary of Louisiana French fiqures of speech divided into
ten categories, each containing ten entries. To complement the entries, an audio file has been created for each entry to allow the user to listen to each individual entry.

# How to use the glossary

* To the left of the page, simply scroll to the category/entry of choice and click on that choice. This will bring up the figure of speech, the literal translation and the general translation on the screen.

* To listen to the corresponding audio file, simply look for and click on the appropriate category and entry number among the grid of buttons that appear directly below the figure of speech that appears on the screen.  It should be noted that the audio file buttons function independantly of the figures of speech, so that the user can listen to them at will to promote mastery of a given figure of speech.
